# Chadbot - User Guide

## Introduction
**Chadbot** is a greenfield Java project modified from the _Duke_ project. The project was created for NUS's software
engineering module, CS2103T.

Chadbot is a simple application which will help you keep track of your tasks. Chadbot differentiates between the
following types of tasks:
* Todos: Tasks without any special features.
